/*
 * File:	Type.h
 *
 * Description:	This file contains the class definition for types in Simple
 *		C.  A type is either a scalar type, an array type, or a
 *		function type.  These types include a specifier and the
 *		number of levels of indirection.  Array types also have a
 *		length, and function types also have a parameter list.
 *		An error type is also supported for use in undeclared
 *		identifiers and the results of type checking.
 *
 *		By convention, a null parameter list represents an
 *		unspecified parameter list.  An empty parameter list is
 *		represented by an empty vector.
 *
 *		No subclassing is used to avoid the problem of object
 *		slicing (since we'll be treating types as value types) and
 *		the proliferation of small member functions.
 *
 *		As we've designed them, types are essentially immutable,
 *		since we haven't included any mutators.  In practice, we'll
 *		be creating new types rather than changing existing types.
